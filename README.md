## Supervised Learning Algorithms:

* **1) K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN folder):**
is a simple and widely used machine learning algorithm for classification and regression tasks. The algorithm works by finding the k closest training examples in the feature space to a new input data point, and then predicting the output label or value based on the majority vote (in classification) or the mean (in regression) of the k nearest neighbors.
